I’m a PhD Student at [HexHive@EPFL](https://hexhive.epfl.ch), advised by [Prof. Mathias Payer](https://https://nebelwelt.net/).
I received my master degree in University of Chinese Academy of Science in 2023 and my
bachelor in Xidian University in 2020. I’m broadly interested in Software and System
security, particularly in Browser Security and Fuzzing.

I actively contribute to open source community by submitting bug reports and intergrating
my research prototypes. So far I reported over 50 CVEs for widely used open source
softwares and integrated my research prototypes in AFL++, one of the most widely used
greybox fuzzing framework.

I enjoy bug hunting on complex software system for fun and ~~profits~~. By leveraging static
analysis, fuzzing and code auditing, I successfully found a series of vulnerbilities in
web browsers and rank #42 in [Google VRP 2024](https://bughunters.google.com/profile/8074163b-0788-4909-845e-2fe6cd37fbb2),
receiving 25,000 USD bug bounties.

Feel free to drop me <a href="mailto:han.zheng@epfl.ch">an email</a> in case of any collaboration
or questions!
